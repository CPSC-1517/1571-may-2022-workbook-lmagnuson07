    The web page is made up of 2 major components:
    a) the layout page located in the folder /Pages/Shared as a file called _Layout
    b) the content page 

    The content page should be placed in the /Pages folder 
    The content page(s) can be placed in a subfolder(s) under the /Pages folder 
    The content page is made up of 2 components in separate files 
        a) xxxx.cshtml file - contains the html controls and display C# logic 
        b) xxxx.cshtml.cs file - this is the PageModel class file. This contains the logic to drive the web page. 
            This does not contain any HTML controls. 
            This does not contain properties for the model class to transfer data between you web controls and the model class properties.
            This file is sometimes referred to as "code-behind"
